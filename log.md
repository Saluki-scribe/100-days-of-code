# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Read some articles to talk me into this challenge, chose a project: my portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** After finishing UCF's coding bootcamp, I just wasn't feeling motivated to code anymore. But once I let go of the tutorials and started working on my own project again, like I'd done in the bootcamps, I'm starting to feel interest again. It was just a matter of opening up the code for my portfolio project and getting right into the code. Hopefully, I'll get further tomorrow.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Added some copy to my portfolio site and positioned the content for the front page.

**Thoughts:** I crashed hard yesterday. I spent a good part of the day sleeping and watching YouTube videos. By the time I went to bed, I hadn't typed a single line of code. I felt like a complete failure--but after some journaling, I resolved to pick myself up and try again the next day. I'm glad I did. With the help of some peppy video game music, my portfolio is starting to look like an actual website now.

### Day 3: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Created and formatted the footer for main portfolio page, along with social media icons/links.

**Thoughts:** I didn't expect to get anything done today. I've been so unsure about where I want to take my web development career: freelance or full time? It's been eating up a lot of my energy. But I told myself that if I just did *one* line of code today, that would be enough. And I ended up coding and formatting the rest of the home page layout. I'm starting to feel energized again.

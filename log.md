# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Read some articles to talk me into this challenge, chose a project: my portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** After finishing UCF's coding bootcamp, I just wasn't feeling motivated to code anymore. But once I let go of the tutorials and started working on my own project again, like I'd done in the bootcamps, I'm starting to feel interest again. It was just a matter of opening up the code for my portfolio project and getting right into the code. Hopefully, I'll get further tomorrow.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Added some copy to my portfolio site and positioned the content for the front page.

**Thoughts:** I crashed hard yesterday. I spent a good part of the day sleeping and watching YouTube videos. By the time I went to bed, I hadn't typed a single line of code. I felt like a complete failure--but after some journaling, I resolved to pick myself up and try again the next day. I'm glad I did. With the help of some peppy video game music, my portfolio is starting to look like an actual website now.

### Day 3: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Created and formatted the footer for main portfolio page, along with social media icons/links.

**Thoughts:** I didn't expect to get anything done today. I've been so unsure about where I want to take my web development career: freelance or full time? It's been eating up a lot of my energy. But I told myself that if I just did *one* line of code today, that would be enough. And I ended up coding and formatting the rest of the home page layout. I'm starting to feel energized again.

### Day 4: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Replaced some of my CSS formatting with Bootstrap, and added an achievements section.

**Thoughts:** Today was my first good coding day. As in, I got an early start, worked on it much longer than I had to, and even found some moments of flow. My online portfolio is now quite the sleek and responsive little site. I'm starting to feel hopeful that I'll be finished by Sunday!

### Day 5: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Added a Contact Me section to portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** I mostly relaxed today, but I did add a "Contact Me" section. Planning to build it out more tomorrow.

### Day 6: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Created a basic contact form.

**Thoughts:** I'm going to make weekends official low-pressure days from now on. All I did was add a very basic contact form with minimal styling. Tomorrow, I'll style the form and finish up the website.

### Day 7: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Styled contact form, added carousel of achievements, added pictures for About section and portfolio.

**Thoughts:** Wow. The difference that waking up at 7:00 AM and coding first thing in the morning makes is astounding! I made more than twice as many commits as I have since starting this challenge, and finished coding everything for my website! I'll make some style adjustments tomorrow, then move on to the next project!

### Day 8: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Adjusted portfolio section. Worked on carousel.

**Thoughts:** I spent most of my coding time trying to get the carousel I coded to work properly. I didn't success, but then, I didn't spend much time coding today. Most of my breakthroughs came from my fiction. Other than the carousel, I finalized my portfolio section and decided on an alternate layout, if I can't get the carousel working tomorrow.

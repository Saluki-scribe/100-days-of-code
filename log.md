# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read some articles to talk me into this challenge, chose a project: my portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** After finishing UCF's coding bootcamp, I just wasn't feeling motivated to code anymore. But once I let go of the tutorials and started working on my own project again, like I'd done in the bootcamps, I'm starting to feel interest again. It was just a matter of opening up the code for my portfolio project and getting right into the code. Hopefully, I'll get further tomorrow.
